		"I'm not sure exactly why the bank is advertising this, it seems like they're asking to be robbed to me,"
		she says. "Oh, I've got to go! We're rolling! Alright, I'm standing in front of the Easy Target Bank, were
		the billionaire-playboy-philantrophist-superhero Fe-Man recently made a large cash deposit of One-Hundred-Million
		dollars! This is the most money that this branch of the bank has ever recieved, and as such they have decided
		to brag on local news to rub it in the faces of every other bank. The money will be stored here overnight, before
		being transferred to a more secure facility by armored truck overnight. There have been some vocal critics- such as
		myself, against this publicity, in fear that they may be robbed by some aspiring super-villain in need of cash. However,
		they have declined offers of extra security and have bafflingly fired most of the security staff that they do have."

Armed with knowledge and your brand new Freeze-Ray, nothing will be able to stop you from getting all the money you need!
Except maybe the police. Everything will probably be fine though, as long as you are careful. But there's just one thing 
to figure out before the robbery- are you going to steal the money from the bank, or from the armored transport?
*line_break
If you strike today, you'll be able to get the money immediatly and get on with the rest of the plan sooner. It might be more difficult 
to escape from inside the building, but it's certainly doable. However, it may be easier to strike the armored transport. Stop the veichle,
get the money, and escape into the city. You'll have to burn an extra day of your time limit, but you can use your time waiting to train and 
prepare for tomorrow. Which will you choose to do?

After giving it much thought, you decide that it would be best to wait a day and steal the money 
while it is being transported. You spend a few hours researching the bank, their transport service,
and the transport route that the bank has conveniently shared with the rest of the world on Twitter.
Once you are confident that you know enough to pull the heist off, you have time to spend the rest 
of your day doing something else. What will you do?

	#Give up
		This is just too difficult. The life of a villain just isn't for you. You gave it a shot, but Creep E. Mann is gonna have to find someone else to be his successor. You're done.

	#Keep moving forward
		You're not giving up now! No matter how hard the path ahead is, you will conquer the world! As long as you are careful, there's surely a way to pull this off.
