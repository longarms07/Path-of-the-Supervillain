(Day ${day})
You wake up at the sound of your alarm, and roll over to turn it off. You slap it, silencing its incessant shrieks. You open your eyes, and standing in front 
of you is a strange man in a buisness suit. He has glowing red eyes, horns jutting out of his finely trimmed hair, and is clutching a clipboard to his chest as 
he stares directly at you. You immediatly jump up.
*line_break
"Who are you!" you shout.
*line_break
"I'm your new personal assistant, Baalphisto the Bringer of Death," he says. "But you can call me Baab. Mr. Mann sent me to assist you in the next phase of your 
world domination. Clean yourself up quickly, there is a lot to discuss and we will need all the time we can get.
*page_break
You shower and get dressed, and then head out to the living room where Baab is sitting and writing on his clipboard.
*line_break
"You took more than three seconds," he says, scribbling furiously. "I'll have to rearrange some of the schedule. But first, there are more important things to attend to. 
The next phase of your global takeover gambit is getting support from the common people. Once we win them over, we'll have enough support to actually keep control of the 
world this time."
*line_break
"How are we going to do that?" you ask.
*line_break
"Well, that is really up to you," Baab replies.
*page_break
"The first step will be making your presence known to the world," he says. "You'll need to have your grand debut, and announce yourself as a major player who intends to 
conquer this miserable rock. Once people know who you are, we can start getting fans. But it's up to you to decide how to introduce yourself to the world. I have two ideas 
that may work, though they will each reach different demographics of people.
*line_break
The first option is to film your big introduction, and upload it to the internet. Everyone can watch and share it, and with some luck it will go viral and win you support among 
the younger population and solidify support for decades to come. Or, we can hold a big press conference event where you reveal yourself as the new greatest villain on live TV. 
You'll reach an older demographic, one that may have more current world power, and will have dedicated reporters circling the news for you with no luck required. Which sounds good to you?"

		"Let's take the online approach," you answer. 
		*line_break
		"Excellent," Baab says. "I'll let you write the script while I go purchase the materials we need. Cameras, lights, editing software, microphones, anything to help production. 
		I will need you to allocate funds for it, of course. The more money you can spare, the higher the production quality will be."

		"Of course I can!" Baab says. "What kind of personal assistant would I be if I couldn't? I'll just need you to allocate me a budget. I need funds to advertise, rent an area, and hire a bunch of people to 
		cover us on TV. It'll be a bit pricey, but the more you can spare the better."

		*choice

				take care of everything else."
				*goto scriptw

			*selectable_if (money >= 10000) #$10,000

				you are taking this seriously, sir. You start preparing your speech, I'll get all this taken care of. You won't be disappointed!"

		"It's not so much a matter of a tragic backstory," you say, "but of a goal: this world is screwed. We need a major leadership change if the human race is to survive, and there is only one person 
		on this entire planet who is worthy of taking on that burden: me. I am not taking overthe world because I want to, oh no. I am taking over the world because I am the only one who can. Only I can 
		set the human race on course for survival, and create the ideal perfect world."
		*line_break
		"And what makes you think that you are worthy?" Jarry asks.
		*line_break
		"Process of elimination, basically." you reply. "Someone has to be able to lead this planet, and literally every other person alive isn't. That leaves me left as the sole person responsible for the fate 
		of everyone."
		*line_break
		"And what makes you think that anyone else will agree with you?" Jarry asks.
		*line_break
		"Quite frankly, I don't care if they agree with me," you say, shooting him a glare. "But if they don't, they're wrong. And I won't tolerate wasting oxygen on failures."
		*line_break

"Alright, this next segment my longtime viewers will know well," Jarry says. "I asked good ole' ${name} here to give me a bit of info about themselves before the show, a character description if you will. Let's see just 
what kind of person our future 'world ruler' is, shall we?"

Jarry pushes the laugh track button, and you sit there fuming. He twisted your words like a demented Madlib, and he wasn't even creative about it! Are you going to tolerate this talentless hack's insults?

		*line_break
		"Oh, don't worry," you say, "I will."

		*line_break
		"Oh?" he says. "and what is that?"
		*line_break
		"I want you to roll this die," you say, hanidng him a standard 6-sided die. "If it lands on anything other than a number from 1-6, I'll give you five bucks."

		"Deal!" Jarry immediatly yells.
		*line_break
		"But here's the catch- if literally anything else happens, you will need to give me $500."

			kick it up into the air. You discreetly pull out your freeze-ray and turn the die to ice, and when it falls to the ground and shatters into pieces. 
			*line_break
			"How did you do that?" Jarry says as he turns to you. You put the freeze-ray away before the camera or Jarry can see it.

				*line_break
				"What are you doing!" he shouts as he starts falling to the ground.
				*line_break
				"Juggling!" you exclaim, as you catch him with one hand, launch it to the other, and do the same with the other items as they come. Despite how heavy everything is, 
				you have no issues at all juggling the items. You manage to keep it up for three solid minutes, without almost dropping anything once.
